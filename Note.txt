--------------------------------------------------------------

Credit card enter logic includes:
- If you are at the beginning of a credit number field and you press ArrowLeft, it will move to the end of the previous credit card input field.

- If you are at the end of a credit card input field (doesn't matter if you only enter 1|2|3 digits only), press ArrowRight will always move to the beginning of the next credit card input field.

- This is for when user highlight some string and then replace with the typing.
  e.g. the input has 1234, user highlight 23 and do a paste value of 56789, then we need to handle to put 1567894 into the input field.

- Can handle paste event, either put the cursor into a position and ctrl+paste. Or highlight some digits and ctrl+paste to replace

- 'tab' will work as normal

- 'delete' will delete the next character and move to the next input box if more to delete. e.g.
  1234 5678 90
  when my cursor is after 6 and i click 'delete' -> 1234 568 90 (with cursor still after 6)
  -> i click 'delete' -> 1234 56 90 (with cursor still after 6)
  -> i click 'delete' -> 1234 56 0 (with cursor still in front of 0)

- 'Backspace' will delete the previous character and move to the previous input box if there is more to delete, e.g.
   1234 5678 9
   When my cursor is after 9 and I click 'Backspace' -> 1234 5678 (with cursor at the beginning of the 3rd input field)
   -> i click 'Backspace' -> 1234 567 (with cursor after 7)
